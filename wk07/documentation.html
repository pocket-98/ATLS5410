<h2 id="proposal">Proposal</h2>
<p>I lost a TV remote to a samsung smartish TV that is connected to the
wifi, so I am able to use the open source project <a
href="https://github.com/Ape/samsungctl">samsungctl</a> running on my
laptop to switch inputs. I would rather have a physical remote with
buttons that can be used to control the TV instead of having to open up
a laptop and typing cli commands. Fixing this pet peeve could be done in
2 ways: by reverse engineering the samsung infrared signals that are
sent by an IR blaster from arduino, or by mimicing the same kind of
packets sent by the open source library over wifi with an esp32. I would
make a couple of physical buttons to connect to either the arduino or
the esp32 and then depending on the technology used, send the wifi
commands or ir signal. The goal would be to build this for a budget of
~$10 because the universal remote costs $40 at bestbuy.</p>

<h2 id="iteration-1">Iteration 1</h2>
<p>First, I tried capturing signals from the arduino kit IR remote and
the IR receiver hooked up to an oscilloscope so I could make sure I
understood the protocol and decode signals, and also have a way of
testing whether the circuit I would later build was functioning
correctly.</p>
<img src="oscilloscope.jpg" width=500/>

<p>Then I used the database of IR Remote codes from the <a
href="https://lirc-remotes.sourceforge.net/remotes-table.html">Linux
Infrared Remote Control project</a> to find the codes for the buttons I
wanted to emulate.</p>
<p>I got an infrared LED that operates at 950nm from sparkfun and
according to the data sheet it requires 100mA of current to operate. It
took a lot of experimentation with a FET to drive the LED at the desired
power. My first iteration only functioned at less than 12 inches away
from the TV. I got more and more bold, eventually pushing the amperage
through the LED to 200mA using a 10<span
class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> resistor. This worked, and now I
was controlling my TV from across the room!</p>
<p>The next step was moving from a breadboard to a perf board and adding
buttons to control various functions like volume and input as well as
power. I also added a power voltage regulator board so that the arduino
could be powered off a 9v battery and a switch is used to fully turn off
the remote to save power. The final demo video can be seen here:</p>
