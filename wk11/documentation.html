<h2 id="proposal">Proposal</h2>
<p>I lost a TV remote to a samsung smartish TV that is connected to the
wifi, so I am able to use the open source project <a
href="https://github.com/Ape/samsungctl">samsungctl</a> running on my
laptop to switch inputs. I would rather have a physical remote with
buttons that can be used to control the TV instead of having to open up
a laptop and typing cli commands. Fixing this pet peeve could be done in
2 ways: by reverse engineering the samsung infrared signals that are
sent by an IR blaster from arduino, or by mimicing the same kind of
packets sent by the open source library over wifi with an esp32. I would
make a couple of physical buttons to connect to either the arduino or
the esp32 and then depending on the technology used, send the wifi
commands or ir signal. The goal would be to build this for a budget of
~$10 because the universal remote costs $40 at bestbuy.</p>
<h2 id="expanded-proposal">Expanded Proposal</h2>
<p>I have a desktop running various virtual machines and acting as a
media server that has as problem: it was exposed to large amounts of
soot and smoke and ever since then, it freezes every couple of days.
This is probably a memory problem, but replacing the RAM dimms didn't
fix it so I think the motherboard has a problem. My current solution is
to reboot it every time it freezes but I wish there was an automatic way
to detect when the server freezes and then force a restart. Now that I
have this homemade <del>bomb-looking-like</del> tv remote that has an
ESP-32 on it, I an expand it's capabilities to also detect when my
server goes offline by checking if it can ping the server through it's
wifi card. Then when it detects that it is frozen, the tv remote can
trigger a relay to act as the push button for restarting the computer. I
also propose wrapping the project in a nice 3D printed enclosure.</p>
<h2 id="iteration-1">Iteration 1</h2>
<p>The first iteration of the project was functional but tethered for
power and just a bunch of components soldered to a perf board. It would
send IR signals to the TV but was tethered for 5V power.</p>

<h2 id="iteration-2">Iteration 2</h2>
<p>The second iteration is a bit more polished: The first step was
getting an 18650 Li-ion cell, a charging UPS module, and dialing the
settings in to tune it to output the desired voltage for the
microcontroller. This board allows the remote to operate either plugged
into a usb-c voltage source which charges the battery while the esp32 is
running or to disconnect from the voltage source and operate from the
battery. From my tests, the remote will function for about 6 hours on
one battery's charge.</p>
<img width="500" src="18650.jpg"/>

<p>Then, the logic for connecting to the wifi, and checking periodically
if the server is online was implemented. Every minute, the
microcontroller will check if it is still on the wifi or not and if
after 5 checks in a row, it is still offline, the microcontroller will
reboot itself. Similarly, every 30 seconds, the microcontroller will do
a tcp request to port 22 on the server and check if the ssh server is
accessible on it. If this fails 5 times in a row, then the
microcontroller will momentarily trigger a relay to the normally open
state which is wired in parallel to the reset button on the motherboard,
causing a reboot.</p>

<p>This is a showcase of the functionality where the remote is both
triggering a reboot on the pc and also functioning as a TV remote at the
same time:</p>

<p>Next, an enclosure was modeled that would hold the perfboard, expose
the IR LED, and have a slot for the usb c charger. This was done in
OpenSCAD so that the parameters of various spots could be
programmatically changed similar to the parametric modeling capabilities
of Grasshopper and Rhino.</p>

<p>Finally, after the enclosure was printed and the parts were fit into
it, this is what the final functioning product looks like:</p>

<p>If I were to refine this project even more, I could design a custom
PCB but the remote as it currently is works very well for my needs. I am
very happy with the result and I think it is a good example of how to
use a microcontroller to do parallel tasks like checking the status of
whether a device is online and then control a relay and also send IR
signals. I am also happy with the enclosure design but it could be
improved if the buttons were integrated with the lid design.</p>
